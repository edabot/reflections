Reflections for Lesson 2!!


The working directory is a place to ID the files that you want to be included in the commit.
Not too sure why you want to exclude files, except for cleanliness in commits.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

This way I can mak changes to multiple files, but if files have different
kinds of changes can segment for a cleaner commit.


What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Branches are very helpful for making new features that can be developed alongside the
master branch, but aren't ready to be combined yet.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

The diagrams help to know where the branches are and what is unreachable. What builds upon what.
This should help in the future when figuring out what is happening on each version
Also, how to go about a merge
