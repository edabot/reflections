When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When working from multiple computers or with another person. Also, just to keep a secure
version if I spill coffee all over my laptop.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are copying someone else's repo on GitHub in order to make your own changes to it
Changes that don't affect the original repo.

Clones copy the repo. Often from GitHub to local, but can be done w/in local.

Branches are parts of the repo that are there to add new features or bug fixes,
but aren't part of the master branch yet.
