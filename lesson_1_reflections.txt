Reflections for version control
Using diff is much easier for spotting the difference as ONLY the differences are called out
this is no big deal for a small file of 40-50 lines or so, but gets to be unwieldy at 100+ lines.
Impossible for even more.

Using VC for history is very efficient as it enables us to see all of the different versions and even roll back to a previous version if we don't like the new direction.

Multi-file commits are useful for when you have files that affect each other. Such as html and js and css docs 

Git log shows all of the commits that have happened to the files(s)

Git diff shows the differences between any two commits

Version control is great because if you break anything you can checkout to a previous version.

Errors can be undone. Even several steps back.

Now that I know how to use Git I want to use it for all of my arduino sketches. What the fuck am I doing? Why not earlier? God damn it.

Also, OpenSCAD files.
